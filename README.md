## How to run a docker:

Change directory to the app directory. Replace \path\to\app with the path to your getting-started\app directory:

'''bash
cd \path\to\app
'''

For building the docker:

> docker build -t getting-started .

For running the docker:

> docker run -dp 5000:5000 getting-started

Than, open your browser and write in the URL

"localhost:5000"
